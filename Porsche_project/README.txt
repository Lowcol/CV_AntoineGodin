school final project

Me and my friend decided to make a our own version of the Porsche site

this project intergrates a database with all of the product in it

the page is also all "automatic" so that if you were to add new product it would integrate automaticaly to the page
we also made the product detail page "automatic" so that we only needed to do 1 page .js page and it fits all 
products

to start the site you need to start the server with the command "npm start" and "npm serve" for the client part
